                                Project StarLight is my personal homelab! For those who don't know, a homelab could be defined as a group of computers that are used at home for server-like tasks (such as hosting services).
                                I use my homelab primarily for hosting all sorts of random stuff I find useful, but I'm also actively developing infrastructure to support it, such as a documentation system. I'm also working
                                to learn about a multitude of technologies from this, such as Linux system administration, automation, networking, and data storage.

                                Flim is a work-in-progress forum that I wrote to learn Flask and Bootstrap. It comes with a web UI along with a JSON based REST API.
                                I have big plans for it in the future, but right now I'm working on other things.

                            I am ever fascinated by computers and the things I can create with them.
                            Since I started learning how to program 3 years ago, I've always felt empowered that I can create anything.
                            I enjoy continue to broaden my knowledge on programming.

                            In addition to computers, I'm rather interested in language history/linguistics.
                            I love learning about the history of languages, and what fascinates me even more is the structure of them.
                            I'm hoping to broaden my knowledge about languages in the future.
